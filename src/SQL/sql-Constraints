# SQL constraints are used to specify rules for the data in a table.
# If there is any violation between the constraint and the data action, the action is aborted by the constraint.
# Constraints can be specified when the table is created (inside the CREATE TABLE statement) or after the table is created (inside the ALTER TABLE statement).

# In SQL, we have the following constraints:

    NOT NULL - Indicates that a column cannot store NULL value
    UNIQUE - Ensures that each row for a column must have a unique value
    PRIMARY KEY - A combination of a NOT NULL and UNIQUE. Ensures that a column (or combination of two or more columns) have a unique identity which helps to find a particular record in a table more easily and quickly
    FOREIGN KEY - Ensure the referential integrity of the data in one table to match values in another table
    CHECK - Ensures that the value in a column meets a specific condition
    DEFAULT - Specifies a default value for a column


# SQL CREATE TABLE + CONSTRAINT Syntax

CREATE TABLE table_name
(
column_name1 data_type(size) constraint_name,
column_name2 data_type(size) constraint_name,
column_name3 data_type(size) constraint_name,
);
